Dataset Abstract

	Visual surveys were conducted in summer 2013 and 2014 to record the insect fauna that occurred on patches of Iva frutescens. Forty-four patches of Iva frutescens at three locations on Sapelo Island, Georgia, were marked for repetitive surveys. Thirty-eight of these patches were sampled in 2014. The patches were visually surveyed every three days from May 29 - June 15, 2013, and from June 1 - July 29, 2014, and the taxon and abundance of insects were recorded. This submission contains three data tables: 1. Insect fauna of Iva patches in 2013. This data set includes observations of 44 patches on 6 sampling dates, and includes Armases crab data. 2. Insect fauna of Iva patches in 2014. This data set includes observations of 38 patches on 20 sampling dates. 3. Structure of Iva patches on Sapelo Island in 2013. This data set contains the dimensions (Length, Width, Height) and surrounding environments of the Iva patches that were surveyed in 2013. The GPS locations of the patches were measured in 2014.
